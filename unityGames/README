Descriptions of the games:

1) Whale Evolution: This is my first (and completed) Unity game. It is a 10 level game where a whale is faced with obstacles
                    and the player must choose a feature for the whale to develop to overcome the obstacles.
                    
                    In this game, I created all the assets and animations on procreate and wrote all the code in C#.
                    I learned how to create my own player controls and how to manipulate scnenes and animation in Unity.
                    
                    
2) Matching Game: This game is a simple memory game. There are 5 computer opponents to play against (me and four of my friends). There are different
                  levels of difficulty depending on who you decide to play against. 
                  
                  The levels work as follows:   easy level: the computer chooses cards at random
                                                medium level: the computer beggins with a small probability of getting a match, and the probability 
                                                              increases throught the game (To simulate an average player)
