# my-projects

Hey,

These are some of my programming projects, some were school projects and some I did on my own. 
Each folder has a README file with its project descriptions

1) Unity games: I got into making games on Unity in the summer (2020) and this folder contains the games I have made since then. I created the C# scripts, drawings and animations for these games.

2) Grocery Store Website:  this is an html/js/css/php shopping website, created as a school project.

3)
