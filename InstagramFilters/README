These are 5 fillters I made on Spark AR from Instagram, you can view them by clicking the links on a mobile device:

1) Umbrella Hat: This filter is a colourful umbrella hat that spins over your head while rain falls. For this filter I 3D designed an umbrella hat and raindrops.

2) Bee Halo: In this filter bees fly around your head. I 3D designed the beed and snimated their wings to move.

3) Smile: This filter has two little people that try to pull the corners of your mouth up. When you smile, they fly away. For this filter I made 2D animations and used Saprk
   AR's patch editor to control the animations.
   
4) Yell: Using this filter, when you open your mouth it yells. I used Spark AR's patch editor to control the sound. (This one is only supported on Apple)

5) Snake Scarf: This filter puts a snake with a party hat around your neck. I 3D designed the snake and animated the toungue to go in and out.
